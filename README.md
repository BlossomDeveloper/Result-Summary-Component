## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

This is a very intuitive component not very hard to do from scratch. I enjoyed the process but I felt that my mobile-first approach didn't achieve the 100% results I would wanted, but I was stuck so many hours trying to fix it that I thought on publish my solution and on the next projects I will be starting with mobile-first and sorting that first!

### Continued development

Definitely I will invest more time studying mobile-first approach as was the most difficult part for
